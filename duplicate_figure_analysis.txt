# Duplicate Figure Analysis from PDF Review

## Schematic (Page 4):
- Current schematic has overlapping text/arrows issue
- Needs to be regenerated with better spacing

## Duplicate Figures Found:
Based on tex file analysis:
1. fig4_entropy_dopamine_fields.png - appears at lines 414 AND 853
2. fig2_algebraic_chain_trajectories.png - appears at lines 398 AND 866
3. fig1b_degenerative_quaternion_components.png - appears at lines 384 AND 1351
4. fig1c_ren01_quaternion_components.png - appears at lines 391 AND 1364
5. fig3_coherence_order_parameter.png - appears at lines 407 AND 1377
6. fig5a_r1_attractor_topology.png - appears at lines 434 AND 1786

## Action Required:
1. Remove duplicate figure references at lines 853, 866, 1351, 1364, 1377, 1786
2. Regenerate schematic with proper spacing (no overlapping arrows/text)
3. Remove "we" language throughout

# REN-01 Manuscript Update TODO List

## Status: IN PROGRESS

---

## Phase 1: Abstract and Introduction
- [ ] 1.1 Update abstract with validation findings (R1-R3 PASS, ablation results)
- [ ] 1.2 Remove AI language from abstract (paradigm, novel, transformative)
- [ ] 1.3 Add empirical data sources (OpenNeuro ds000245, PubChem CID 66553195)
- [ ] 1.4 Update introduction with simulation results summary

## Phase 2: Insert Figures with Full Captions
- [ ] 2.1 Add Figure 1a (healthy quaternion components) with full caption
- [ ] 2.2 Add Figure 1b (degenerative quaternion components) with full caption
- [ ] 2.3 Add Figure 1c (REN-01 quaternion components) with full caption
- [ ] 2.4 Add Figure 2 (algebraic chain trajectories) with full caption
- [ ] 2.5 Add Figure 3 (coherence order parameter) with full caption
- [ ] 2.6 Add Figure 4 (entropy/dopamine fields) with full caption
- [ ] 2.7 Add system schematic figure with full caption
- [ ] 2.8 Add Figure 5a (R1 attractor topology) with full caption
- [ ] 2.9 Add Figure 5b (R2 overlaid histograms) with full caption
- [ ] 2.10 Add Figure 5c (R2 box plots) with full caption
- [ ] 2.11 Add Figure 5d (ablation ordering) with full caption
- [ ] 2.12 Add Figure 5e (ablation fields) with full caption
- [ ] 2.13 Add Figure 5f (ablation summary) with full caption

## Phase 3: Add Validation Section
- [ ] 3.1 Create new section "Validation Studies" after simulations
- [ ] 3.2 Add subsection "Regime Uniqueness Tests (R1-R3)"
- [ ] 3.3 Add subsection "Ablation Ladder Analysis"
- [ ] 3.4 Add validation results table
- [ ] 3.5 Add empirical parameters table

## Phase 4: Move and Update Conclusion
- [ ] 4.1 Move conclusion section earlier (before experimental plan)
- [ ] 4.2 Update conclusion with validation findings
- [ ] 4.3 Add quantitative results (χ values, p-values)
- [ ] 4.4 Remove AI language from conclusion

## Phase 5: Remove AI Language Throughout
- [ ] 5.1 Search and replace "novel" with specific descriptors
- [ ] 5.2 Search and replace "paradigm" with "framework" or "approach"
- [ ] 5.3 Remove unnecessary hyphens
- [ ] 5.4 Remove meta language and robotic cadence
- [ ] 5.5 Ensure natural scientific writing flow

## Phase 6: Update Results Section
- [ ] 6.1 Add quantitative simulation results
- [ ] 6.2 Add collapse metric values (χ_healthy=5.2, χ_degen=0.9, χ_REN01=6.9)
- [ ] 6.3 Add dopamine field values from empirical data
- [ ] 6.4 Add statistical significance values

## Phase 7: Final Compilation and Review
- [ ] 7.1 Compile manuscript with pdflatex
- [ ] 7.2 Run bibtex for citations
- [ ] 7.3 Recompile twice for references
- [ ] 7.4 Check page count and formatting
- [ ] 7.5 Verify all figures render correctly
- [ ] 7.6 Commit final version to repository

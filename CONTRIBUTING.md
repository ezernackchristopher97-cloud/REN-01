# Contributing to REN-01

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the REN-01 research project.

## Project Scope

REN-01 is a theoretical research project developing a quaternionic entropy field model for Parkinson's disease therapeutics. The project includes mathematical modeling, computational simulations, and manuscript preparation.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Contributions

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch
2. Ensure code follows existing style conventions
3. Include documentation for new functions and modules
4. Test simulations locally before submitting
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of changes

### Manuscript Contributions

1. All manuscript edits must be made to the LaTeX source (ren01.tex)
2. Ensure the document compiles cleanly with pdflatex and bibtex
3. Add citations to references39.bib using consistent formatting
4. Verify figure references match files in the figures/ directory

### Data Contributions

1. Document all data sources with proper citations
2. Include provenance information in data/data_sources.csv
3. Ensure reproducibility of parameter extraction

PAGE 1 (Abstract):
- Title: REN-01: A Novel Opioid-Derived Compound for Stabilizing Recursive Entropy Dynamics in Dopaminergic Neural Circuits
- Author: Christopher Ezernack
- Date: January 20, 2026
- REOP logo present
- Abstract VERIFIED with corrections:
  * "proposed compound designed to bias regime persistence" - CORRECT
  * "test perturbation of regime dynamics" - CORRECT
  * "quaternion valued algebraic framework" - CORRECT
  * "model-defined proxy measures" - CORRECT
  * "Quaternion components represent abstract interacting contributions" - CORRECT
  * "do not correspond to physical coordinates, rotations" - CORRECT
  * "entropy proxy is not thermodynamic entropy and does not decrease" - CORRECT
  * "stabilization corresponds to limiting its accumulation" - CORRECT
  * "REN-01 condition" (not "treatment") - CORRECT
  * "mechanism biasing regime persistence" - CORRECT
  * "modeling approach" (not "therapeutic approach") - CORRECT

PAGE 2 (Disclaimer + Introduction):
- Disclaimer present and appropriate
- Introduction begins with proper citations
- No obvious layout issues

CHANGES VERIFIED:
1. Abstract rewritten with regime/bias language
2. Quaternion algebraic disclaimer added
3. Entropy proxy clarification added
4. "treatment" replaced with "condition"
5. "therapeutic mechanism" replaced with "mechanism biasing regime persistence"

REMAINING TO CHECK:
- Figure captions
- Introduction language
- Methods section
- Results section
- Conclusion

PAGE 5 (Figure 1 - System Schematic):
- Figure 1 caption VERIFIED with disclaimer:
  * "This diagram illustrates ordered interaction logic only"
  * "does not represent spatial geometry, network topology, or system trajectories"
  * "All components are model-defined and simulated"
- Schematic shows complete BBB drug delivery system
- Left column: A-F boxes (MIF Stealth Complex through CSF Barrier Protocol)
- Right column: 1-6 boxes (Enhanced Drugs through Therapeutic Outcomes)
- Blood-Brain Barrier center element
- Key interventions box at bottom
- NOTE: Schematic still shows "Dopaminergic Restoration" - needs fix to "Dopaminergic Regime Stabilization"

PAGE 6 (Molecular Structure Placeholders):
- Figure 2: REN-01 placeholder (Parkinson's Disease) - PRESENT
- Figure 3: REN-02 placeholder (Alzheimer's Disease) - PRESENT
- All 5 REN variants have placeholders

PAGE 7 (More Molecular Structure Placeholders):
- Figure 4: REN-03 placeholder (Schizophrenia) - PRESENT
- Figure 5: REN-04 placeholder (ALS) - PRESENT

ISSUES FOUND:
1. Figure 1 schematic image shows "Dopaminergic Restoration" - needs image update
2. Figure captions for molecular structures use "optimal" language - needs review

PAGES 75-79 (Conclusion and References):
- Section 12: Conclusion is properly placed at end (page 75)
- Conclusion content verified:
  * "REN-01 represents a therapeutic approach targeting entropy stabilization"
  * OpenNeuro ds000245 data mentioned
  * PubChem TRV130 data (CID 66553195) mentioned
  * Three distinct dynamical regimes confirmed
  * MOR agonism 75%, CB2 18%, entropy modulation 7%
  * Quaternionic field formulation on S^3 mentioned
  * "algebraic structure of quaternions" - CORRECT
  
- References section starts page 75 bottom
- References verified present: Adler 1995, Alpay 2016, Araque 2009, Athauda 2017, etc.
- All citations appear to be rendering correctly
- 79 pages total

ISSUE FOUND ON PAGE 75:
- Still says "REN-01 treatment" - needs to be "REN-01 condition"
- Still says "therapeutic approach" - needs review

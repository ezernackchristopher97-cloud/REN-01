## ABSTRACT SECTION
- [ ] Add sentence: entropy is model-defined proxy, not thermodynamic
- [ ] State quaternions used only for algebraic order sensitivity
- [ ] Reframe chemical involvement as test perturbation, not intervention

## INTRODUCTION SECTION
- [ ] Replace smooth evolution language with regime transition language
- [ ] Replace causal verbs with probabilistic/bias-based verbs
- [ ] Add early definition: connectivity = functional regime coupling, not anatomy
- [ ] Remove "progression", "pathways", "evolution toward" language

## MODEL OVERVIEW / METHODS
- [ ] Add: quaternion components have no spatial/physical interpretation
- [ ] Lock entropy to ONE definition: accumulated destabilizing proxy
- [ ] Define regime thresholds as parameter-defined constructs
- [ ] State F is bounded and normalization preserving
- [ ] State noise is additive before normalization
- [ ] Clarify F is not optimized or minimized

## QUATERNION USAGE
- [ ] Add: "Q(t) components represent abstract interacting contributions, not physical coordinates"
- [ ] Replace all "acts on" with "is composed with"
- [ ] State closure under defined update rule
- [ ] Add: "Quaternion multiplication encodes ordered composition, not directional causation"
- [ ] Remove any rotation/orientation/manifold language

## ENTROPY DEFINITIONS
- [ ] Lock to ONE definition everywhere
- [ ] Add: "Entropy proxy is not thermodynamic and does not decrease"
- [ ] Add: "Stabilization = limiting accumulation, not reversing value"
- [ ] Replace "reduces entropy" → "limits entropic load accumulation"
- [ ] Replace "reverses entropy" → "counteracts destabilizing load"
- [ ] Replace "entropy decreases" → "biases accumulation dynamics"

## REGIME LOGIC
- [ ] State threshold is fixed before simulation
- [ ] Replace performance language with classification language
- [ ] Add: "Regime indicator is descriptive classifier only"
- [ ] Define noise distribution once and early
- [ ] Add: "Regime transitions are noise driven, not parameter driven"

## RESULTS SECTION
- [ ] Replace all outcome language with "bias toward persistence"
- [ ] State when curves are ensemble averages
- [ ] Reinforce regime-level interpretation throughout

## FORBIDDEN LANGUAGE SWEEP
- [ ] Remove: controls → biases
- [ ] Remove: regulates → constrains
- [ ] Remove: modulates activity → alters likelihood
- [ ] Remove: intervenes → shifts regime behavior
- [ ] Remove: corrects → (delete)
- [ ] Remove: restores → biases toward regime persistence
- [ ] Remove: recovers → reduces likelihood of regime exit
- [ ] Remove: improves → increases time in functional regime
- [ ] Remove: normalizes → (delete)
- [ ] Remove: repairs → (delete)
- [ ] Remove: leads to → is associated with
- [ ] Remove: causes → biases toward
- [ ] Remove: results in → increases likelihood of
- [ ] Remove: evolution toward → regime transition
- [ ] Remove: pathway → noise driven shift
- [ ] Remove: trajectory → state update under perturbation
- [ ] Remove: flow → (delete)
- [ ] Remove: rotation → algebraic composition
- [ ] Remove: orientation → ordered interaction
- [ ] Remove: manifold → bounded state representation
- [ ] Remove: performs better → exhibits greater regime persistence
- [ ] Remove: optimal → (delete)

## FIGURE CAPTIONS
- [ ] Figure 1: Add "ordered interaction logic only, not spatial/network/trajectory"
- [ ] Figure 2+: State single runs vs ensemble averages
- [ ] Figure 2+: Rename axes to "regime indicator" or "proxy measure"
- [ ] All figures: Must include "simulated", "model defined", "regime level", "not predictive"
- [ ] All figures: Add variance bands if averaging used

## CITATIONS
- [ ] Verify each citation supports only what it explicitly demonstrates
- [ ] State which modality each citation refers to
- [ ] Clarify citations motivate framing, not validate model
- [ ] State when entropy is metaphorical/proxy based
- [ ] Limit quaternion citations to algebra only
- [ ] Cite PubChem strictly as registry
- [ ] Add disclaimer for any bioactivity data

## SIMULATIONS
- [ ] Verify all equations match implemented code
- [ ] Run full simulation pipeline
- [ ] Save logs and seeds
- [ ] Regenerate all figures from code

## DATA INTEGRATION
- [ ] Integrate OpenNeuro datasets with citations
- [ ] Integrate PubChem references with citations
- [ ] Create DATA_SOURCES.csv
- [ ] Create RESULTS_SUMMARY.csv

## REPOSITORY
- [ ] Organize: source/, code/, data/, figures/
- [ ] Update README.md with reproducibility instructions
- [ ] Ensure clean compilation

## GLOBAL CONSISTENCY CHECKS
- [ ] Stability = persistence under noise (everywhere)
- [ ] Entropy = proxy, always destabilizing (everywhere)
- [ ] Quaternions = algebraic only (everywhere)
- [ ] Connectivity = functional regime level (everywhere)
- [ ] Chemistry = illustrative only (everywhere)
- [ ] Validation = qualitative only (everywhere)

# PDF Verification Notes - 2026-01-20

## Document Structure
- Total pages: 88
- Compiles cleanly with no errors

## Page 1 (Title/Abstract)
- Title: REN-01: A Novel Opioid-Derived Compound for Stabilizing Recursive Entropy Dynamics in Dopaminergic Neural Circuits
- Author: Christopher Ezernack
- Date: January 20, 2026
- REOP Solutions logo present
- Abstract properly formatted with key metrics visible

## Page 2 (Disclaimer)
- Disclaimer section present and properly formatted
- States: "We present a theoretical and computational framework..."
- No clinical claims made
- Requires experimental validation

## Pages 68-72 (Figures and Appendix)
- Figure 16: REN-01 Complete Blood Brain Barrier Drug Delivery System schematic
- Figure 17: REN-01 Molecular Structure placeholder (Parkinson's Disease)
- Figure 18: REN-02 Molecular Structure placeholder (Alzheimer's Disease) - IN APPENDIX
- Figure 19: Duplicate schematic (needs cleanup)
- Figure 20: REN-01 Molecular Structure placeholder (duplicate)
- Figure 21: REN-02 Molecular Structure placeholder (duplicate)
- Figure 22: REN-03 Molecular Structure placeholder (Schizophrenia)

## Issues Found
1. REN-02-05 placeholders appear BOTH in main body AND appendix (duplicates)
2. System schematic appears twice (pages 68 and 70)
3. Need to remove duplicates from main body, keep only in appendix

## Conclusion Section
- Needs to be verified for disclaimer placement

PDF Review Notes for ren01.pdf (Updated)
=========================================

COMPILATION STATUS: SUCCESS
Total Pages: 71
File Size: 6.5 MB

CITATIONS: All resolved (no more ?? marks visible)

FIGURES STATUS:
- Molecular structure figures (REN-01 through REN-05): Commented out as placeholders
- Simulation figures need to be verified - checking pages 30-34 shows text content but no figures yet

CONTENT REVIEW (Pages 24-34):
- Page 24: Simulation parameters section looks good with proper math notation
- Page 25: Limitations and Future Extensions section
- Page 26: Stochastic Process Foundation with proper equations
- Page 27: Collapse Metric section with proper chi formula
- Page 28: Clinical Interpretation section with hypothesis language ("pending experimental validation")
- Page 30: Updated Methodology section
- Pages 31-34: Advanced methods sections

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. Need to verify simulation figures are properly included in the document
2. Need to check figure references in tex file match generated PNG files

NEXT STEPS:
1. Check which figure references exist in tex file
2. Ensure all generated figures are properly referenced
3. Push to repository


FIGURE VERIFICATION (Pages 10-14):
===================================
All simulation figures are rendering correctly in the PDF:

Page 10: Figure 1 - Quaternion Component Evolution (HEALTHY)
  - Shows q0 (Dopaminergic), q1 (Entropy-i), q2 (Astrocytic), q3 (Entropy-k)
  - Four subplots with time evolution
  - Caption mentions S^3 constraint maintained

Page 11: Figure 2 - Algebraic Chain Evolution in Quaternion Space
  - 3D plot showing (q1, q2, q3) space
  - Three scenarios: Healthy (green), Degenerative (red), REN-01 (blue)
  - Shows tight clustering for healthy, drift for degenerative, restoration for REN-01

Page 12: Figure 3 - Quaternion Coherence and Coupled Fields
  - Coherence Evolution: Dopaminergic vs Entropic Components
  - Shows oscillating coherence order parameter
  - Three scenarios compared

Pages 13-14: Section 4 - Final Chemical Structure (REN-01)
  - Text content about G protein biased MOR agonist
  - Dual-target population engagement
  - Entropy-modulating moiety

STATUS: All figures rendering correctly. Citations resolved. Document compiles successfully.

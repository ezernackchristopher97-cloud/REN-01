PLACEHOLDERS VERIFIED:
- REN-01: In main body (Chemical Structure section)
- REN-02: Figure 14, page 67 (Alzheimer's Disease)
- REN-03: Figure 15, page 67 (Schizophrenia)

DISCLAIMER VERIFIED:
- Page 65: Full disclaimer paragraph at start of Conclusion
- States quaternion components are abstract algebraic quantities
- States they do NOT correspond to physical coordinates, rotations, or measurable neural variables
- States therapeutic outcomes are simulated model outputs only

NOTATION VERIFIED:
- phi_E = q1^2 + q2^2 + q3^2 (entropy density)
- psi_D = q0^2 (dopamine density)
- A = q2^2 (astrocyte projection)
- chi = collapse metric (defined consistently)
